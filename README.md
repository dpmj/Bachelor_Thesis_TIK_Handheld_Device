# Bachelor's Thesis: *"Development of an acoustic measurement system of the Modulus of Elasticity in trees, logs and boards"*

These are the public available documents of my Bachelor's Thesis, titled: *"Development of an acoustic measurement system of the Modulus of Elasticity in trees, logs and boards"*, with which I finish the Degree in Telecommunications Engineering at the Universidad de Granada. It has been developed with the help of the [GranaSAT Electronics Aerospace Group](https://granasat.ugr.es/) ([@granasat](https://github.com/granasat)) and [IDIE-ADIME](https://idie.ugr.es/idie-adime/) teams, and under the European [LIFE Wood for Future](https://life-woodforfuture.eu/en/) project. 

This project constitutes the first iteration that begins the development of a device capable of measuring the Modulus of Elasticity of wood -a figure of great value for structural purposes- in a non-destructive way through the analysis of acoustic signals. 

The project covers all the steps in the development of an electronic product: conception, specification of requirements, choice of architectures, components, topologies, etc., including circuit and PCB design, mechanical and product design, as well as manufacturing, assembly, firmware and verification of a prototype.
