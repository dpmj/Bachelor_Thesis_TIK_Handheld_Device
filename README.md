# TIK handheld device 


These are the public available documents for the first generation of TIK (Tree Inspection Kit) handheld device. This work is my My Bachelor's Degree final project at the University of Granada. 

It consists of a portable device capable of accurately measuring the delay between two signals in microseconds. Signals come from piezoelectric sensors, one sensor tagged as *emitter* and the other from the *receiver* sensor. These sensors are nailed on a standing tree or trunk and are separated a known distance through the longitudinal axis. The *emitter* is hammered and transmits the mechanic wave through the tree, which is picked by the *receiver*. The travel time can be used to measure the Modulus of Elasticity given the trunk's wood density. 
This device can also measure the weight from a load cell and has an expansion port for future development.
